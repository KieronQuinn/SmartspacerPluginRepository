         This issue type is for updating the owner of a Smartspacer Plugin in the repository to a different GitHub user. 
         
         You **MUST** request this from the **current owner** of the plugin (usually the original account which created the plugin on the repo). 
         
         If this is not possible, open a general request and explain the situation. After validation, plugins can be transferred manually.
