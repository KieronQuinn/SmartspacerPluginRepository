# Smartspacer Plugin Repository Code of Conduct

1. Your Plugin

Your Plugin must contain no illegal content, including that where it and the Smartspacer Plugin Repository is hosted. By submitting a plugin, you accept responsibility for its contents, and agree you have sought permission to use any copyrighted or trademarked material contained within it.

2. Your Submission

Your Plugin Submission, including author name, description and screenshots must contain no profanity, use of illicit substances, or adult material. Smartspacer is available to all, so please be considerate.

3. Your Account

It is your responsibility to make sure your account is secure, and to take the required steps to prevent unauthorised actors from uploading updates or changing your Plugin's details without your permission. If you find your account has been breached, make a General Request issue with proof of ownership of the original account, and request its access be revoked immediately. Keep your keystore secure, to prevent malicious actors from uploading an update which could be installed on top of your previously signed APKs.

Any breaches of this Code of Conduct may result in your Plugin being removed without warning, and serious or repeat offences may result in being banned from submitting to the repository.
